# wind_turbine

This project performs an in-depth analysis of wind turbine data to understand its operational performance, identify trends, and uncover insights that can aid in optimization and maintenance.

We utilize the Wind Turbine SCADA Dataset available on Kaggle, which includes operational data for a wind turbine. The dataset provides key metrics like wind speed, power output, temperature, and other SCADA parameters.
